# Tri-Lingual Turing Agent Pipeline

A multi-agent translation system that explores semantic drift through a round-trip translation pipeline (English → French → Hebrew → English) with spelling error robustness analysis.

## Project Overview

This project implements a "Turing machine"-style pipeline composed of three sequential AI translation agents to measure how spelling errors in input text affect semantic preservation through multiple translation steps.

## Features

- Three-agent translation pipeline (EN→FR→HE→EN)
- Automated spelling error injection at configurable rates
- Semantic similarity measurement using embeddings
- Visualization of error rate vs. semantic drift

## Documentation

See the [RPD Document](RPD.md) (Research/Product/Design) for detailed specifications and implementation plans.
